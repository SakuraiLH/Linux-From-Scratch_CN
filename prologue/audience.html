      <p>
        有很多原因会驱使你来读这本书。很多人都会提的一个问题是, <span class=
        "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">当你能直接下载一个现成的发行版
        时, 为什么还要去手动构建一个 Linux 系统呢?</span>&rdquo;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        这个项目存在的一个重要目的, 就是为了让你学习 Linux 系统是怎么从里到外工作的。
        构建一个 LFS 系统能够演示是什么让 Linux 运转起来,
        各种部件都是怎样在一起互相依赖着运行的。在 LFS 项目中最棒的事情,
        莫过于你能够按照你自己独特的需求来定制一个
        你想要的Linux系统。
      </p>
      <p>
        Another key benefit of LFS is that it allows you to have more control
        over the system without relying on someone else's Linux
        implementation. With LFS, you are in the driver's seat and dictate
        every aspect of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        LFS allows you to create very compact Linux systems. When installing
        regular distributions, you are often forced to install a great many
        programs which are probably never used or understood. These programs
        waste resources. You may argue that with today's hard drive and CPUs,
        such resources are no longer a consideration. Sometimes, however, you
        are still constrained by size considerations if nothing else. Think
        about bootable CDs, USB sticks, and embedded systems. Those are areas
        where LFS can be beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another advantage of a custom built Linux system is security. By
        compiling the entire system from source code, you are empowered to
        audit everything and apply all the security patches desired. It is no
        longer necessary to wait for somebody else to compile binary packages
        that fix a security hole. Unless you examine the patch and implement
        it yourself, you have no guarantee that the new binary package was
        built correctly and adequately fixes the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of Linux From Scratch is to build a complete and usable
        foundation-level system. If you do not wish to build your own Linux
        system from scratch, you may nevertheless benefit from the
        information in this book.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are too many other good reasons to build your own LFS system to
        list them all here. In the end, education is by far the most powerful
        of reasons. As you continue in your LFS experience, you will discover
        the power that information and knowledge truly bring.
